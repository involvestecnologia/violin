# Localization

Violin has a simple localization module. It was built with React Context and it is as easy to use as any other React Context implementation.

```javascript
import { LocalizationContext } from "@involves/violin";

const App = () => {
  return (
    <>
      <GlobalStyle />
      <LocalizationContext value={customLocale}>
        { /** Violin components goes down here in the tree */ }
      </LocalizationContext>
    </>
  )
}
```

## Locale Object

You can find the default locale object [here!](https://github.com/involvestecnologia/violin/blob/asyncawait/innovation/localization/src/lib/localization/defaultLocale.js)


As for now it is really simple:

```javascript
const defaultLocale = {
  Select: {
    noOptionsText: 'Sem opções',
  }
}
```

And you can use it like this:

```javascript
import { LocalizationContext } from "@involves/violin";

const customLocale = {
  Select: {
    noOptionsText: 'Custom message',
  }
}

const App = () => {
  return (
    <>
      <GlobalStyle />
      <LocalizationContext value={customLocale}>
        { /** Violin components goes down here in the tree */ }
      </LocalizationContext>
    </>
  )
}
```
