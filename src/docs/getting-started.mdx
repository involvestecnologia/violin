# Overview

Violin is a components library to build UI faster with React.

## Install 

```shell
// with npm
npm install styled-components @involves/violin

//with yarn
yarn add styled-components @involves/violin
```

> `styled-components` is required

## Open Sans font

Violin was designed with the Open Sans font in mind. You can load via Google Web Fonts:

```xml
<link rel="stylesheet" href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,600,700&display=swap" />
```

## Font Icons

In order to use the font Icon component, you must first add the [Material icons](https://material.io/tools/icons/) font with *Round* style. You can load via Google Web Fonts:

```xml
<link rel="stylesheet" href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/icon?family=Material+Icons+Round" />
```

## Global styles (recomended)

`GlobalStyle` component adds global setting styles as default font family, font sizes, color and [normailze](https://necolas.github.io/normalize.css/):

```javascript
import { GlobalStyle } from "@involves/violin";

const App = () => {
  return (
    <>
      <GlobalStyle />
      { /** */ }
    </>
  )
}
```

## Using components

```jsx
import { Button } from "@involves/violin";

<Button>Enjoy!</Button>
```
